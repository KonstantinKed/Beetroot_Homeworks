# Make a program that has some sentence (a string) on input and returns a dict containing all unique words as keys and the number of occurrences as values.

# Task 2
# Create a function which takes as input two dicts with structure mentioned above, then computes and returns the total price of stock.

# Task 3
# List comprehension exercise
# Use a list comprehension to make a list containing tuples (i, j) where `i` goes from 1 to 10 and `j` is corresponding to `i` squared.
