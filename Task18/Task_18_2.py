# Implement 2 classes, the first one is the Boss and the second one is the Worker.
#
# Worker has a property 'boss', and its value must be an instance of Boss.
#
# You can reassign this value, but you should check whether the new value is Boss.
# Each Boss has a list of his own workers. You should implement a method that allows you
# to add workers to a Boss. You're not allowed to add instances of Boss class to workers
# list directly via access to attribute, use getters and setters instead!
